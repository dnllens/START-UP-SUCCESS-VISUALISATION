# Start-Up Success Prediction Visualizations

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the visualization aspect of the "Predicting the Likelihood of Success or Failure of Start-Up Businesses" project. It extends the original Machine Learning model by providing comprehensive visualizations created with Tableau, designed to enhance the interpretability and accessibility of our predictive analysis. 

## Visualizations

The visualizations in this project aim to provide clear insights into the factors that affect start-up success, as predicted by our Machine Learning model. They are intended to help stakeholders quickly grasp complex data relationships and contribute to informed decision-making processes.

## Data

The data visualized here is the same "Big Start-up Success/Fail Dataset from Crunchbase" used in the original project, encompassing 66,368 entries across 14 variables.

## Tableau Dashboard

A Tableau dashboard has been developed to showcase the visualizations interactively. It includes:

- Funding Analysis: Visuals depicting the relationship between funding amounts and start-up success rates.
- Location Insights: Maps indicating start-up success distribution geographically.
- Sector Trends: Charts representing sector-wise success prediction.
- Funding Rounds Impact: Graphs analyzing the impact of the number of funding rounds on start-up outcomes.

## Usage

To view and interact with the visualizations:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Tableau Desktop or access Tableau Public.
3. Open the `.twbx` files located in the `visualizations` directory.

## Prerequisites

The following tools are required to run the Tableau visualizations:

- Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public
